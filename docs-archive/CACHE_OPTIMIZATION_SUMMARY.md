## Cache Optimization Summary

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Unnecessary Image Generation on Startup**
   - **Problem**: App marked cached images as outdated even when they were for the current block
   - **Fix**: Check if cached image matches current block before marking as outdated
   - **Code**: Updated `_generate_initial_image()` to verify block height/hash

2. **Inaccurate Cache Validation**
   - **Problem**: `_has_valid_cached_image()` didn't check if image was for current block
   - **Fix**: Added real-time block verification in cache validation
   - **Code**: Enhanced `_has_valid_cached_image()` with mempool API check

3. **Concurrent Image Generation**
   - **Problem**: Multiple background threads could generate images simultaneously
   - **Fix**: Added generation lock to prevent duplicate work
   - **Code**: Added `self.generation_lock` and proper locking in `_background_image_generation()`

4. **Cache State Lost on Restart** ⭐ **NEW**
   - **Problem**: App restart loses in-memory cache state (`cached_height=None`) even with valid image files
   - **Fix**: Persistent cache metadata in `cache.json`
   - **Code**: Added `_load_cache_metadata()` and `_save_cache_metadata()` functions

### Expected Behavior Changes:

**Before Fix:**
```
Aug 08 10:48:23 mempaper[3062]: 📸 Using existing cached image (age: 19 minutes)
Aug 08 10:48:23 mempaper[3062]: ✓ Skipping initial image generation for faster startup
...
Aug 08 10:51:00 mempaper[3062]: ⚠️ Cached image exists but is outdated
Aug 08 10:51:00 mempaper[3062]: 🎨 No current image available, starting background generation
```

**After Fix:**
```
Aug 08 10:48:23 mempaper[3062]: 📸 Using existing cached image (age: 19 minutes)
Aug 08 10:48:23 mempaper[3062]: ✓ Image is current for block 909149, skipping generation
...
Aug 08 10:51:00 mempaper[3062]: ✅ Serving current cached image (no regeneration needed)
```

**After Restart (NEW - Cache Persistence):**
```
Aug 08 11:06:22 mempaper[3154]: 📸 Cache metadata restored: Block 909150 is still current
Aug 08 11:06:22 mempaper[3154]: ✓ Skipping initial image generation (cache is up-to-date)
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Faster startup** - No unnecessary image generation when cache is current
2. **Immediate response** - Clients get cached images instantly without waiting
3. **Resource efficiency** - Prevents duplicate concurrent image generation
4. **Accurate detection** - Only regenerates when block actually changes
5. **⭐ Restart persistence** - Cache state survives app restarts via `cache.json`

### Cache Metadata System:

The new persistent cache system stores essential state in `cache.json`:
```json
{
  "block_height": 909150,
  "block_hash": "0000000000000000000008300d868a9f18e6177ac1f8e44add3375665d57d4a4",
  "timestamp": 1691494456.789,
  "image_path": "current.png",
  "eink_image_path": "current_eink.png"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- App restart no longer triggers unnecessary regeneration
- Cache state persists across deployments and updates
- Smart age validation (max 2 hours before forced refresh)
- Graceful fallback if metadata is corrupted

### Testing Commands:

To verify fixes are working:
```bash
# Restart and monitor
sudo systemctl restart mempaper.service && sleep 3 && journalctl -u mempaper.service -f --since "3 seconds ago"

# Look for these GOOD messages:
# ✅ "Image is current for block X, skipping generation"
# ✅ "Serving current cached image (no regeneration needed)"
# ✅ "Image generation already in progress, skipping"

# Should NOT see these BAD messages:
# ❌ "Cached image exists but is outdated" (when block hasn't changed)
# ❌ Multiple "Starting background image generation" at same time
```
